# Snake Game using Python Curses with Voice Controls

## How to Run

```
python main.py
```

## Controls

### Keyboard Controls
Press an arrow key to start. Press `[` and `]` to speed up/down.

### Command Line Controls
This game has optional (and very pointless) command line input. Type a direction (eg. `left`), and hit enter.

### Voice Controls
To enable voice, install the dependencies below and then press `v`. Say `left` or `right` into your microphone.

## Dependencies

This project has no external dependencies unless you want to use voice controls.

### Voice Dependencies

To use voice controls, additional installation steps may be required on OSX. See [PyAudio instructions](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
